      <h1>2: Identical Diamonds</h1>
      <aside>
        The key word to watch out for is "identical" diamonds. This means that
        it doesn't matter what diamonds someone has, but only what number of
        diamonds someone has.
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 3 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>3: It looks the same!</h1>
      <aside>
        The order that you give the diamonds to the people doesn't matter. Which
        diamonds you give people doesn't matter either!
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 4 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>4: Let's explore one interesting counting method.</h1>
      <aside>
        There are other ways to count the number of ways to distribute 5
        identical diamonds among 3 robbers. This is just one way.
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 5 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>5: Let's start by rearranging the diamonds and people boxes.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can rearrange the lines and diamonds so they look more like this.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 6 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>6: They are all arranged in a line!</h1>
      <aside>
        Notice how the order of the diamonds and lines shows how many diamonds a robber has.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 7 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>7: The distribution of diamonds has changed.</h1>
      <aside>
        One diamond was taken from robber 1 and given to robber 2.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 8 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>8: There are too many lines.</h1>
      <aside>
        The diamond has to cross over two lines in order to be considered as belonging to another person. If the diamond only crosses over one line, the diamond does not belong to any robbers. We don't want that, as we want to leave the museum with all of the diamonds.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 9 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>9: We can get rid of unnecessary lines.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can combine the two lines in the middle into one line. And remove the lines on the edges as they also don't mean anything.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 10 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>10: Changing the position of these lines changes how many diamonds each robber has.</h1>
      <aside>
        To find out the total number of ways we can distribute the 5 diamonds to the 3 robbers, we just need to find the total number of ways we can order the lines and diamonds. 
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 11 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>11: Take this time to try to think about how we can do this.</h1>
      <aside>
        Try it out! Grab a pencil and a sheet of paper and try to figure it out!
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 12 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>12: Remember that all of the diamonds are the same.</h1>
      <aside>
        We already know that since all of the diamonds are the same changing the order of these diamonds doesn't matter. So really, the only thing that matters is the position of these two lines.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 13 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>13: Imagine there are slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can create slots in between the diamonds where we can place our two lines.      
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 14 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>14: Lets place the lines in different slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        See how placing the lines in different slots changes how many diamonds a robber has?      
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 15 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>15: So there are four slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        And they can either have a line in them or not. There are two lines that need to be used. Since all of the diamonds are the same, let's get rid of them! 
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 16 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>16: We can place the lines in these slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can place the two lines in these four slots in a bunch of different ways. The way that we place lines in these slots shows how many diamonds one robber has.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 17 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>17: What if we said the first two slots were where we always placed the lines?</h1>
      <aside>
        So, we keep the lines in the same spot and reorder the slots instead? 
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    
    <!-- slide 18 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>18: What does this mean?</h1>
      <aside>
        This means that the teal and pink slots are the ones that will have lines in them.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 19 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>19: We can remember that the original order of the slots was: yellow, green, teal, and pink.</h1>
      <aside>
        That means that the lines are placed in the 3rd and 4th slots.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 20 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>20: This is how the distribution in this scenario would look.</h1>
      <aside>
        So if we find all the combinations of the first two slots, we can figure out all the different ways we could give 5 diamonds to 3 robbers. 
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 21 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>21: How do we do this?</h1>
      <aside>
        We will cover the way to find all the possible combinations mathematically now.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 22 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>22: As discussed before, the first two positions are where the lines will be placed and the last two slots are where nothing will be placed.</h1>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 23 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>23: Let's start filling the positions in order from left to right.</h1>
      <aside>
        There are four (4) slots for the first position, three (3) options for the second position, two (2) options for the next position, and one (1) option for the last position.     
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 24 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>24: Multiplying the number of options for each position gives us the number of possible arrangements.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can find the total number of orderings by multiplying those numbers: <br> 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 25 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>25: But we don't care about the ordering of the last two. All that matters is that they are not in the first two positions. </h1>
      <aside>
        There are two (2) options for the 3rd position and one (1) option for the 4th position. Therefore the total number of orderings are: <br> 2 x 1
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 26 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>26: We divide the total number of orderings for all the positions by the total number of orderings for just the last two positions.</h1>
      <aside>
        This is because we don't care about the ordering of the last two: <br> (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (2 x 1)     
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 27 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>27: But wait! We also do not care about the ordering of the first two either!</h1>
      <aside>
        All that matters it that they have a line in them.     
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 28 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>28: In the same way, there are two options for the first one and two options for the second one.</h1>
      <aside>
        The total number of combinations is 2 x 1.    
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 22 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>29: Since we don't care about the ordering of these to, same as before, we can divide the final number by the number of orderings for the first two.</h1>
      <aside>
        (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (2 x 1) / (2 x 1) = 6
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 23 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>2: There are 6 different ways to distribute 5 idential diamonds to 3 different robbers!</h1>
      <aside>
        You just solved a college level discrete mathematics problem! Wow - you rock!

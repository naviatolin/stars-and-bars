      <h1>1: Distributing 5 identical diamonds among 3 robbers.</h1>

      <h1>2: Identical Diamonds</h1>
      <aside>
        The key word to watch out for is "identical" diamonds. This means that
        it doesn't matter what diamonds someone has, but only what number of
        diamonds someone has.
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 3 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>3: It looks the same!</h1>
      <aside>
        The order that you give the diamonds to the people doesn't matter. Which
        diamonds you give people doesn't matter either!
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 4 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>4: Let's explore one interesting counting method.</h1>
      <aside>
        There are other ways to count the number of ways to distribute 5
        identical diamonds among 3 robbers. This is just one way.
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- slide 5 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>5: Let's start by rearranging the diamonds and people boxes.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can rearrange the lines and diamonds so they look more like this.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 6 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>6: They are all arranged in a line!</h1>
      <aside>
        Notice how the order of the diamonds and lines shows how many diamonds a robber has.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 7 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>7: The distribution of diamonds has changed.</h1>
      <aside>
        One diamond was taken from robber 1 and given to robber 2.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 8 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>8: There are too many lines.</h1>
      <aside>
        The diamond has to cross over two lines in order to be considered as belonging to another person. If the diamond only crosses over one line, the diamond does not belong to any robbers. We don't want that, as we want to leave the museum with all of the diamonds.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 9 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>9: We can get rid of unnecessary lines.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can combine the two lines in the middle into one line. And remove the lines on the edges as they also don't mean anything.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 10 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>10: Changing the position of these lines changes how many diamonds each robber has.</h1>
      <aside>
        To find out the total number of ways we can distribute the 5 diamonds to the 3 robbers, we just need to find the total number of ways we can order the lines and diamonds. 
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 11 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>11: Take this time to try to think about how we can do this.</h1>
      <aside>
        Try it out! Grab a pencil and a sheet of paper and try to figure it out!
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 12 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>12: Remember that all of the diamonds are the same.</h1>
      <aside>
        We already know that since all of the diamonds are the same changing the order of these diamonds doesn't matter.
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 13 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>13: Imagine there are slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        We can create slots in between the diamonds where we can place our two lines.      
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 14 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>14: Lets place the lines in different slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        See how placing the lines in different slots changes how many diamonds a robber has?      
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 15 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>15: So there are four slots.</h1>
      <aside>
        Let's number them!      
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 16 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>16: Imagine that we can reorder these slots and the first two will be where we place the lines.</h1>
      <aside>
        For example, if the order is 4, 3, 2, 1. Then the fourth slot and the third slot is where we would place the lines.      
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 17 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>17: There are four options for the first slot, three options for the second slot, two options for the next slot, and one option for the last slot.</h1>
      <aside>
        So we could find the total number of combinations by multiplying those numbers: 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.     
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 18 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>18: We don't necessarily care about the last two since they are blanks.</h1>
      <aside>
        For the last two, there are 2 options for the first slot, and 1 option for the last slot. So, 2 x 1 total number of combinations.     
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 19 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>19: We can divide the total number of combinations for yes and no, by the total number of combinations for no.</h1>
      <aside>
        4 x 3 x 2 x 1 / 2 x 1.     
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 20 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>20: We also don't necessarily care about the order of the first two either.</h1>
      <aside>
        They are both identical lines and the order of them doesn't matter.     
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 21 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>21: In the same way, there are two options for the first one and two options for the second one.</h1>
      <aside>
        The total number of combinations is 2 x 1.    
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 22 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>22: Therefore we can divide the final number again by (2 x 1).</h1>
      <aside>
        (4 x 3 x 2 x 1/ 2 x 1)/(2 x 1)
      </aside>
    </section>
    
    <!-- slide 23 -->
    <section class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity: 0;">
      <h1>23: And thats the answer!</h1>
      <aside>
        You just solved a college level discrete mathematics problem! Wow - you rock!
